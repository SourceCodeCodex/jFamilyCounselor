         The LOOSE Research Group  is focused on the evolution and re-engineering of object-oriented software systems. All research activities of the LOOSE Research Group follow an iterative approach starting with basic research which is then concretized in two directions: on the one hand in the academic field, and on the other hand in collaborations with the industry.
