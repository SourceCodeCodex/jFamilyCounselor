      jFamilyCounselor proposes a metric-based static code analysis,
capable of identifying fragments containing hidden familial type
correlations in Java source code. What are hidden familial type
correlations and how jFamilyCounselor detects them are widely
presented in: Alin-Petru Roșu, Petru-Florin Mihancea, Towards
the Detection of Hidden Familial Type Correlations in Java Code,
LOOSE Research Group, 2022.
